# HCIA AI Final Project: Flower Species Classification

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the Huawei HCIA AI V3.5 course in collaboration with Cairo University. The goal of this project is to classify flowers into their respective species using two machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Problem Definition

The task is to classify flowers based on their features into one of three species: 
- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

We utilized KNN and SVM algorithms to build models that predict the species of an unknown flower based on its features.

## Aim

The primary goal is to successfully classify test samples into the correct species. KNN is particularly suitable for this task due to the small size of the dataset and the limited number of classes.

## Objectives

This project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a classification model from scratch. The focus is on understanding how KNN works by implementing it from the ground up, including:
- Building a distance function
- Implementing majority voting
- Combining everything into a cohesive function for classification

Additionally, the project compares the performance of KNN with SVM to determine which model is better suited for this specific classification problem.

## Expected Outcomes

The expected outcome is to accurately predict the species of each flower in the dataset. Given the clean and small dataset, a high success rate is anticipated. By evaluating the accuracy and other performance metrics, we aim to identify the most suitable model for flower species classification.
